# Implementation log

## Phase 5a — pre-session checklist + saved setups (2026-09-25)

- **Checklist** (desktop Setup, above Start): microphone, interviewer audio source, resume/JD selected, network round
  trip, plus server checks (`GET /v1/preflight`: database, DeepSeek responding, Deepgram key valid, vision, live
  minutes / screenshot credits, app version) — each with a precise fix. Collapsed when all is well; failures expand
  and the button reads "Start anyway". Provider checks are cached (D23).
- **Saved setups** (`/v1/workspaces`, migration `a1f3c7e9d2b5`): save the current session setup under a name, pick it
  next time (documents + preferences restored, last one remembered), update or delete it. Sessions record the
  workspace they came from; a workspace's documents are used when a session doesn't pass its own.

**Verified in the real desktop app** (test build + local server with real keys): checklist showed real statuses
(DeepSeek 715 ms, Deepgram key valid, resume/JD missing flagged with fixes); a setup saved, restored after leaving
and reopening Setup, and the session started from it was linked (`session_count` 1). API 239 tests (+6).

## Phase 4 — answer quality (2026-09-24)

- **Question detection** (measured on the brief's phrases plus a monologue/filler corpus):
  - Before: missed "A little more on the security side.", "Go on.", "Say more about the rollout.", "Two sum, given an
    array of integers.", "So the next thing I wanted to ask is how you handle secrets"; "Expand on that.", "Talk me
    through your thinking.", "Hmm, and the database layer?" sat in the never-used LLM band. It also auto-answered 12
    statements such as "Design is a big part of our culture here." and "Tell me is what my manager always says."
  - After: all 22 required phrases trigger, 0 of 23 statements/fillers/logistics do (with and without a recent
    question). Bare continuers ("Go on.", "Why?") count only right after a question.
- **Ambiguous-band classifier** (`live/classifier.py`, D21). Real DeepSeek: 9/10 correct on hard cases, resisted an
  injected instruction, median 0.67 s (only for ambiguous utterances), and resolves references ("Hmm, the caching
  layer." → "How did you design the caching layer of the payments service?").
- **Fact safety** (D22): `GROUNDED` label + "Suggested details" badge; sharper rule that a verified fact anchors only
  what it says. Audit before: a fully invented failure story (7 unsupported claims) and invented rollout steps, both
  presented as fact. After: invented detail still appears for questions the resume can't support, but every such
  answer was labelled `example` (12/12 over two runs). Technical/design/coding answers are labelled `general`, first
  words unchanged (0.52–0.73 s).
- **Duplicate suppression**: the brief's "Tell me… / Tell me about… / Tell me about yourself" case is pinned by a test
  (one question, one answer).
- Real-audio regression run (Deepgram + DeepSeek): filler ignored, three questions answered, latency unchanged.

**Verified:** API 233 tests (+56) + 15 smoke (new: real classifier); ruff, strict mypy; UI 42 tests, typecheck, lint.
**Not done in this phase:** neural/hybrid retrieval (current lexical retrieval kept), token-level context budget
(a character budget exists), prepared/cached answers.

## Phase 3 — Windows audio reliability (2026-09-24)

- **Stable device identity:** microphones and outputs are listed and opened by MMDevice endpoint id (legacy saved
  names still resolve). The Setup screen remembers the mic and output choice.
- **Recovery:** unplug/replug, Bluetooth drop, device invalidation and default-device switches reopen capture by
  itself; a missing chosen device falls back to the default and switches back when it returns. Live shows
  "Microphone disconnected — reconnecting…" / "reconnected" / "switched to …".
- **Call audio:** new "Call audio — communications device" choice, plus any specific output. On the dev PC the
  default output (Realtek Digital Output) and the communications device (Speakers) differ, so a Teams call routed to
  the communications device was previously inaudible to Orbit.
- **Resampling:** Windows converts to 16 kHz mono (AUTOCONVERTPCM + SRC_DEFAULT_QUALITY) on the capture path.
- **Silence fill:** output loopback emits silence frames while nothing plays, keeping end-of-speech detection and
  the latency timeline working.

**Verified on real hardware** (test build driven over CDP): endpoint ids listed with default/communications flags;
TTS through the default output captured (RMS 0.097); 20 frames/s of silence with nothing playing; communications
choice opens Speakers; bogus saved ids fall back with a `fallback` status; switching the Windows default output
mid-capture (Digital → Speakers → Digital, restored afterwards) produced `switched` → `switched` with no frame gap.
Rust 18 tests, clippy -D warnings, fmt; desktop typecheck + lint.

**Needs manual hardware:** USB/Bluetooth unplug-replug, HDMI outputs and sleep/wake weren't physically exercised
(the same reopen path handles them: device invalidation → reopen); Teams/Zoom routing to the communications device.

## Phase 2 — platform (2026-09-24)

Decisions for a private deployment: one API instance (D12), no Stripe or backup provider yet (D17), Sentry built in
but off (D18).

- **Real-provider smoke suite** (`tests/smoke`, opt-in with `RUN_PROVIDER_SMOKE=true`; manual GitHub workflow).
  DeepSeek: text + priced usage, streaming, JSON mode, vision, timeout mapping. Deepgram: interim → final + endpoint,
  reconnect, every language in the app. **It found two real bugs**, both fixed:
  - `language: "auto"` sent `detect_language=true`, which Deepgram streaming rejects (HTTP 400) → now `language=multi`.
  - HTTP 400 handshakes were retried forever → now fatal ("unsupported transcription settings").
- **Deepgram reconnects keep one timeline:** timestamps restart at 0 on each socket; events are now shifted by the
  audio sent to earlier sockets (unit-tested). The unused "last packet → transcript" metric was removed.
- **Real latency metrics** (`live/metrics.py`): speech start → first partial, speech end → final / question /
  first AI word, question → first AI word; stored per session (`sessions.metrics`, migration `9d5e2f8a1b47`),
  p50/p95/p99 via `GET /v1/admin/latency` and desktop **Settings → Latency**. First real run: speech end → final
  326 ms, → question 1.88 s (mostly the Balanced 1.5 s wait), question → first word 679 ms, speech end → first word
  2.58 s.
- **Observability:** JSON logs in production with `request_id` / `user_id` / `session_id`, `X-Request-ID`
  propagation, secret redaction (keys, bearer tokens, JWTs, WS tickets, Deepgram tokens), optional Sentry with
  scrubbing.
- **CI:** `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy -D warnings` added (the tree was formatted in a separate commit).

**Verified:** API 177 tests (+9) + 14 smoke (all green against the real providers), ruff, strict mypy; UI 42 tests,
typecheck, lint; Rust 17 tests, fmt, clippy -D warnings; migration round trip + `alembic check` on SQLite.

## Phase 1 — critical correctness & security (2026-09-24)

Audit of the upgrade brief's P0 list against `main` @ cab0d95; every item below was confirmed in code first.

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| P0-3 | Per-app loopback built a Rust slice from a possibly-null WASAPI buffer before the silent check (UB) | Slice only built for a non-silent, non-null, non-empty packet; down-mix moved to a safe `packet_to_mono` helper (any channel count, short buffers padded) with unit tests |
| P0-4 | Production with `ORBIT_ADMIN_EMAIL` unset: open sign-up and first user = unlimited admin | Production refuses to boot without `ORBIT_ADMIN_EMAIL`; admin never inferred from registration order in production; allowlist never falls open |
| P0-5 | Pricing table knew only `deepseek-chat/reasoner`; production model `deepseek-flash` costed $0; cache hits ignored | `providers/llm/pricing.py`: DeepSeek list prices (cache hit/miss/output, peak/off-peak), `ORBIT_LLM_PRICING_JSON` overrides, unknown model → cost `NULL` + warning; `cached_input_tokens` parsed and stored |
| P0-6 | Live minutes written only at socket close (crash = unbilled) and checked only at connect | 15 s heartbeat commits one idempotent row per connection and enforces the limit mid-session across all the user's sessions; `usage.status` warning (< 5 min) and graceful end at 0 (`4003`) |
| P0-7 | In-process live state ambiguous for multiple instances | Documented decision: production is single-instance until live state moves to Redis (DECISIONS D12) |
| P0-10 | "Store screenshots" toggle did nothing (server always discards) | Toggle removed; truthful copy; API ignores the flag and always reports `false` |
| P0-11 | Screenshot credit charged before analysis | Credit spent only when the answer completes (keyed per question); `screenshot_attempts` / `screenshot_failures` internal metrics |
| P0-12 | Desktop accepted plain `http://` remote servers (password/token in cleartext) | `checkServerUrl`: https required except loopback / dev builds; insecure saved override ignored; inline reason shown |
| P0-14 | Recorder logged and dropped failed writes (usage, cost, transcript) | Bounded retries with backoff → `failed_writes` dead letter → local spool → replay on boot; fixed PKs + usage upserts make retries idempotent; live teardown shielded from handler cancellation and drained on shutdown |
| P0-15 | `session.ended` waited up to 30 s for the report; `/end` used a non-durable BackgroundTask | Reports are DB-backed jobs (claim via conditional UPDATE, retry with backoff, stale-job recovery, dedupe per session); `report_status` on sessions; History shows "Generating the report…" and polls |

Migration `8c4d1e7f2a30`: `usage.idempotency_key` (unique), `provider_requests.cached_input_tokens`,
nullable `estimated_cost_usd`, `failed_writes`, `jobs`.

**Verified:** API 168 tests (+16), ruff, strict mypy; UI 42 tests (+4), typecheck, lint; Rust 17 tests (+4),
clippy clean; migration upgrade/downgrade/`alembic check` on SQLite; a real DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash run recorded
cost with cache hits (1,408 of 1,602 input tokens) and charged each screenshot once.

**Not verified here:** the migration against Postgres (no local Postgres; runs on the next Render deploy, where a
failure rolls back and the old deploy keeps serving). The loopback fix changes code that only runs on real
per-app capture: it needs a desktop release to reach users.
